# Sequence-to-Sequence Models in Tensorflow & Keras

This project is still very much evolving each day, but the core goals are:
* Recreate the results described in the paper, "A Neural Conversation Model" [TODO: link to paper], but with the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus as the dataset.
* Explore various implementations and/or improvements to the standard sequence-to-sequence model described in "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks."
* Create a cleaner user interface for tinkering with such models and with many dataset options.
* Make a fun chatbot that can learn across datasets and can remember more than just the previous response.
